# 2026-02-11 - Avatar Research Notes (Preliminary)

## LEGION Research in Progress
4 agents deployed simultaneously to research character creator options:

| Agent | Mission | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Scout | Web-based character creators with morphing | 🔍 Active |
| Architect | SDF/procedural body generation tech | 🔍 Active |
| Quartermaster | Commercial alternatives (CC3, DAZ3D, etc) | 🔍 Active |
| Artisan | AI-powered character transformation | 🔍 Active |

## Initial Findings

### 1. UMA (Unity Multipurpose Avatar)
- Open source, free
- DNA-based morphing using bone transforms
- Can export to WebGL/GLB

### 2. mannequin.js
- Pure JavaScript, procedural
- Already tested in prototypes
- Scalable body parts

### 3. Quaternius Universal Base Characters
- CC0 license
- Game-ready, ~13k tris
- Retargetable animations

### 4. MeshPhysicalMaterial
- Can upgrade current capsules
- Skin-like appearance
- Clearcoat for "sweat" effect

## Camera Fix Deployed
- v0.5.6: Responsive canvas on prototype page
- Should fix mobile view issues

## Waiting For Full Report
- Scout: 10+ web-based solutions
- Architect: 8+ technical implementations
- Quartermaster: 12+ commercial alternatives
- Artisan: 8+ AI-based approaches

Total expected: 38+ options to evaluate!
