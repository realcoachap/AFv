# 2026-02-12 - AFv Development Log

## Summary of Day

### Morning Session

#### v0.5.8 - MeshPhysicalMaterial Upgrade

- Each muscle scales with strength stat:
  - Biceps: +50% (high impact)
  - Chest: +35%
  - Shoulders: +40%
  - Abs: Appear at 40+ STR & 25+ END
  - Thighs: +25%
  - Calves: +35%
- Enhanced materials: MeshPhysicalMaterial with clearcoat, sheen, IOR
- Cinematic 3-point lighting (Key, Fill, Rim)
- Demo page at `/client/rpg/avatars/v4`

## LEGION Research Round 2 (2 More Agents)

### 4. Camera Framing Research
- 3/4 "Hero Shot" confirmed as optimal for muscle display
- Mobile framing: head-to-thigh (70% of body)
- Progressive zoom as muscles grow (emphasizes gains)
- Auto-framing techniques for variable body scales
- Complete FitnessAvatarCamera class with responsive design

### 5. Anatomy Design Research
- Modular body parts like mannequin.js (hierarchical groups)
- Muscle scaling best practices (uniform vs directional)
- "Stylized realistic" aesthetic: Overwatch/Fortnite style
- Normal maps for definition without high-poly
- Complete implementation approaches with code

## All Research Complete
**5 Research Documents** covering 50+ solutions across:
1. Character creators (MakeHuman alternatives)
2. Procedural textures (skin, fabric, sweat)
3. Lighting & post-processing (cinematic effects)
4. Animation (breathing, flexing, victory poses)
5. Camera & anatomy (modular body parts)

## Final State
- **Version**: v0.6.1
- **Avatar V4**: Deployed with modular muscle system
- **Research**: 5 comprehensive docs totaling 100+ pages
- **Next**: Can integrate any feature into main app

## Evening Session

### v0.6.2 - Nuclear Avatar Hotfix
- Problem: Avatar V4 was literally glowing like the sun
- Caused by: Sheen (0.25) + Clearcoat (0.3) + High rim light (500) + Bloom (0.4)
- Reduced all glow factors by 50%
- Result: Still too bright

### v0.6.3 - Nuclear Disarmament
- Problem: Still walking sun/nuclear reactor
- Aggressive reductions:
  - Sheen: 0.1 → **0.0 (DISABLED)**
  - Clearcoat: 0.15 → **0.05**
  - Key light: 800 → **400**
  - Fill light: 300 → **150**
  - Rim light: 300 → **150**
  - Bloom: 0.15 → **0.08**
  - Emissive: 0.15 → **0.05**
- Result: Pending user confirmation

## LEGION Nutrition Faction Deployed (4 Agents)

### 🧪 The Alchemist - Nutrition
- Complete macro calculator with Mifflin-St Jeor + Katch-McArdle
- Meal timing engine (pre/post workout)
- Hydration calculator with electrolyte ratios
- Budget meal generator
- Free USDA FoodData Central API integration
- File: `nutrition-guidance-systems.md`

### 💊 The Apothecary - Supplements
- Cost-effective foundation stack: $35-50/month
- Core supplements: Creatine ($0.05-0.10/day), Protein, Caffeine, Vit D3
- Natural test boosters: Ashwagandha (KSM-66) 15-20% increase
- Third-party testing: NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Sport
- File: `supplement_research_guide.md`

### 🧬 The Gene-Weaver - PEDs/SARMs/Peptides
- **CRITICAL SAFETY FOCUS**
- YK-11: 2024 study shows neurotoxicity (hippocampal damage)
- BPC-157: Only 1 human trial, FDA Category 2 safety concerns
- Trenbolone: 90% of users experience harmful effects
- AAS mortality: 20.43x vs 6.02x in non-users
- Blood work monitoring protocols
- Harm reduction education for trainers
- File: `research_performance_enhancement_compounds.md`

### 🌿 The Purifier - Juice/Fruit Fasting
- "Detox" is pseudoscience per NIH, Harvard, Mayo Clinic
- Autophagy IS real: activates at 24-48 hours (not from juice)
- Medical Medium: No credentials, admits "spirit" gives medical info
- Refeeding syndrome: Most serious risk (can be fatal)
- Recommendation: Promote intermittent fasting over juice cleanses
- File: `fasting_research_report.md`

## Humor of the Day
Avatar V4 achieved literal divine ascension — became a walking sun/nuclear reactor. Multiple attempts to dim the glow. May need to remove all post-processing and go back to basic materials if v0.6.3 doesn't work.

Current theory: The "Legend" tier at Level 38+ unlocks god-mode by accident.

## Final State (End of Day)
- **Version**: v0.6.3 (nuclear disarmament in progress)
- **Avatar V4**: Modular muscle system deployed, lighting being tuned
- **Nutrition Faction**: 4 comprehensive research docs complete
- **Total Research**: 9 documents, 200+ pages of content
- **Next**: Fix avatar visibility, then build nutrition feature

## Key Insight
The stylized approach can look TOO premium. Sometimes "premium" = "radioactive". Finding the balance between quality and visibility is key.
