# 2026-02-11 - AFv Development Log

## Deployments

### v0.5.7 - Mannequin.js Prototype
- Built full-body avatar evolution system
- Custom Three.js implementation (no external deps)
- Muscle/Height/Weight sliders with real-time scaling
- Pose selector: Stand / Flex / Walk
- Body part-specific scaling (arms, chest, legs independently)

### v0.5.6 - Mobile Camera Fix
- Fixed responsive canvas on prototype page
- Aspect ratio properly handles mobile screens

### v0.5.5 - Avatar Prototype Lab
- 4 interactive prototypes comparing approaches:
  1. Basic capsules (current)
  2. MeshPhysicalMaterial (enhanced)
  3. Metaball muscles (organic)
  4. Scalable anatomy (best)
- Muscle scale slider for testing

### v0.5.4 - RPG Features Dropdown Restored
- Full NavBar with 🎮 RPG Features dropdown
- All avatar demos accessible

### v0.5.3 - NavBar Fix + Resources Link
- Fixed NavBar to show on Dashboard page
- Added Resources link prominently

## LEGION Research Complete

**4 agents deployed simultaneously:**
- **Scout**: 15 web-based character creators
- **Architect**: 20 technical/procedural solutions  
- **Quartermaster**: 15 commercial alternatives
- **Artisan**: 12 AI-powered systems

**Total: 50+ solutions found**

### Top Recommendations:
1. **Unity UMA** - FREE, open source, full morphing
2. **Avatar SDK** - $40/mo, professional, API-driven
3. **GauHuman** - FREE, AI-powered, real-time
4. **Character Creator 4** - $299, best quality
5. **mannequin.js** - FREE, simple, Three.js-based

## Key Technical Findings

### Body Evolution Approaches:
| Approach | Effort | Quality | Evolution |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| glTF Morph Targets | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Perfect |
| SDF Raymarching | Hard | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Organic |
| MeshPhysicalMaterial | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Same |
| Bone Scaling (current) | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐ | Perfect |

### Best for "Fat to Fit" Visualization:
1. **GauHuman** (189 FPS, 1-2 min training)
2. **InstantAvatar** (60 sec generation)
3. **Avatar SDK** (SMPL-based parameters)
4. **Unity UMA** (free DNA system)

## Current State
- **Stable version**: v0.5.7
- **Mannequin prototype**: `/client/rpg/avatar-mannequin`
- **Research report**: `LEGION_CHARACTER_RESEARCH_COMPLETE.md`
- **50+ solutions documented**

## Next Decisions Needed
1. **Quick win**: MeshPhysicalMaterial upgrade (1 day)
2. **Solid upgrade**: UMA or mannequin.js integration (1 week)
3. **Professional**: Avatar SDK subscription ($40/mo)
4. **Advanced**: Custom glTF morph pipeline (1 month)

## Key Insights
- "Evolvable avatar" problem is **solved multiple ways**
- Trade-off is cost vs quality vs time
- Current capsule system actually works well for evolution
- Mannequin.js provides good middle ground
